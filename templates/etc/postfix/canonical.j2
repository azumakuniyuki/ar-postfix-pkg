# CANONICAL MAPS
# =================================================================================================
# canonical_maps (default: empty)
#   Optional address mapping  lookup tables  for message headers and envelopes.  The mapping is ap-
#   plied  to both sender and recipient  addresses, in both envelopes and in headers, as controlled
#   with the canonical_classes parameter. This is typically  used to clean up  dirty addresses from
#   legacy mail systems,  or to replace  login names by "Firstname.Lastname".  The table format and
#   lookups  are documented in  canonical(5).  For an overview of Postfix address manipulations see
#   the ADDRESS_REWRITING_README document.
#
#   Note: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address mapping happens only when message header
#         address rewriting is enabled:
#
#     - The message is received with the Postfix sendmail(1) command,
#     - The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,
#     - The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter
#       specifies a non-empty value.
