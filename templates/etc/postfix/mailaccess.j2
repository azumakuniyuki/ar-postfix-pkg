# SMTPD SENDER RESTRICTIONS (MAIL FROM)
# --------------------=============================================================================
# smtpd_sender_restrictions (default: empty)
#   Optional restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of a client MAIL FROM
#   command. See SMTPD_ACCESS_README, section "Delayed evaluation of SMTP access restriction lists"
#   for a discussion of evaluation context and time. The default is to permit everything.
#
#   The following restrictions are specific to the sender address received  with the MAIL FROM com-
#   mand.
#
#   - check_sender_access type:table
#       Search the specified access(5)  database for the MAIL FROM address, domain, parent domains,
#       or localpart@, and execute the corresponding action.
#
#   - check_sender_a_access type:table
#       Search the specified  access(5) database for the IP addresses for the MAIL FROM domain, and
#       execute the corresponding action. Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.
#       Instead, use "DUNNO" in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists. This feature is a-
#       vailable in Postfix 3.0 and later.
#
#   - check_sender_mx_access type:table
#       Search the specified access(5) database for the MX hosts for the MAIL FROM domain, and exe-
#       cute the corresponding action. Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.In-
#       stead, use DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists. This feature is avail-
#       able in Postfix 2.1 and later.
#
#   - check_sender_ns_access type:table
#       Search the specified  access(5) database for the DNS servers  for the MAIL FROM domain, and
#       execute the corresponding action. Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.
#       Instead, use "DUNNO" in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists. This feature is a-
#       vailable in Postfix 2.1 and later.
#
#   - reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch
#       Enforces  the  "reject_sender_login_mismatch" restriction  for authenticated  clients only.
#       This feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.
#
#   - reject_known_sender_login_mismatch
#       Apply the "reject_sender_login_mismatch" restriction only to "MAIL FROM" addresses that are
#       known in $smtpd_sender_login_maps. This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 and later.
#
#   - reject_non_fqdn_sender
#       Reject the request when the MAIL FROM address specifies a domain that is not in fully-qual-
#       ified  domain form as required by  the RFC.  The "non_fqdn_reject_code" parameter specifies
#       the response code for rejected requests (default: 504).
#
#   - reject_rhsbl_sender rbl_domain=d.d.d.d
#       Reject the request when the  "MAIL FROM" domain is listed with the A record "d.d.d.d" under
#       "rbl_domain"  (Postfix 2.1 and later only).  Each "d" is a number, or a pattern inside "[]"
#       that contains one or more ";"-separated numbers or "number..number" ranges (Postfix version
#       2.8 and later). If no "=d.d.d.d" is specified, reject the request when the MAIL FROM domain
#       is listed with any A record under rbl_domain. 
#
#       The "maps_rbl_reject_code" parameter specifies the response code for rejected requests (de-
#       fault: 554);  the "default_rbl_reply" parameter specifies the default server reply; and the
#       "rbl_reply_maps" parameter specifies tables with server replies indexed by "rbl_domain".
#       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
#
#   - reject_sender_login_mismatch
#       Reject the request when "$smtpd_sender_login_maps" specifies an owner for the MAIL FROM ad-
#       dress,  but the client is not (SASL) logged in as that MAIL FROM address owner; or when the
#       client is (SASL) logged in, but the client login name doesn't own the MAIL FROM address ac-
#       cording to $smtpd_sender_login_maps.
#
#   - reject_unauthenticated_sender_login_mismatch
#       Enforces the "reject_sender_login_mismatch" restriction for unauthenticated clients only.
#       This feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.
#
#   - reject_unknown_sender_domain
#       Reject the request  when Postfix is not final destination  for the sender address,  and the
#       MAIL FROM domain has 1) no DNS MX and no DNS A record, or  2) a malformed MX record such as
#       a record with a zero-length MX hostname (Postfix version 2.3 and later).
#
#       The reply is  specified with the  "unknown_address_reject_code"  parameter  (default: 450),
#       "unknown_address_tempfail_action" (default: defer_if_permit),  or 550 (nullmx, Postfix ver-
#       sion3.0 and later). See the respective parameter descriptions for details.
#
#   - reject_unlisted_sender
#       Reject the request when the MAIL FROM address is not listed in the list of valid recipients
#       for its domain class.  See the "smtpd_reject_unlisted_sender" parameter description for de-
#       tails. This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
#
#   - reject_unverified_sender
#       Reject the request when mail to the MAIL FROM address is known to bounce, or when the send-
#       er address destination is not reachable. Address verification information is managed by the
#       verify(8) server; see the ADDRESS_VERIFICATION_README file for details. 
#
#       - The unverified_sender_reject_code parameter specifies the numerical response code when an
#         address is known to bounce  (default: 450, change into 550 when you are confident that it
#         is safe to do so). 
#
#       - The "unverified_sender_defer_code" specifies the numerical response code when an address
#         probe failed due to a temporary problem (default: 450). 
#
#       - The "unverified_sender_tempfail_action"  specifies the action after address probe failure
#         due to a temporary problem (default: defer_if_permit).
#
#       - This  feature breaks for aliased addresses with "enable_original_recipient = no" (Postfix
#         <= 3.2).
#
#       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
#
#   Other restrictions that are valid in this context:
#     - Generic restrictions that can be used in any SMTP command context, described under
#       "smtpd_client_restrictions".
#     - SMTP command specific restrictions described under "smtpd_client_restrictions" and 
#       smtpd_helo_restrictions.
#     - SMTP command specific restrictions described under "smtpd_recipient_restrictions".
#       When recipient restrictions are listed under "smtpd_sender_restrictions", they have
#       effect only with "smtpd_delay_reject = yes", so that $smtpd_sender_restrictions is
#       evaluated at the time of the RCPT TO command.
