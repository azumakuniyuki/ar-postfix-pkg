# VIRTUAL ALIAS DOMAINS
# =================================================================================================
# virtual_alias_domains (default: $virtual_alias_maps)
#   Postfix is final destination for the specified list of virtual alias domains, that is, domains
#   for which all addresses are aliased to addresses in other local or remote domains. The SMTP
#   server validates recipient addresses with $virtual_alias_maps and rejects non-existent recipi-
#   ents. See also the virtual alias domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.
#
#   The default value is $virtual_alias_maps so that you can keep all information about virtual a-
#   lias domains in one place. If you have many users, it is better to separate information that
#   changes more frequently (virtual address -----> local or remote address mapping) from informa-
#   tion that changes less frequently (the list of virtual domain names).
#
#   See also the VIRTUAL_README and ADDRESS_CLASS_README documents  for further information.
