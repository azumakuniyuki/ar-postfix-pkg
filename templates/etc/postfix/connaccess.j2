# SMTPD CLIENT RESTRICTIONS (SMTP CONNECTION)
# =================================================================================================
# smtpd_client_restrictions (default: empty)
#   Optional restrictions  that the Postfix SMTP server  applies in the context of a client connec-
#   tion request. See "SMTPD_ACCESS_README", section "Delayed evaluation of SMTP access restriction
#   lists" for a discussion of evaluation context and time.  The default is to allow all connection
#   requests.  The following restrictions are specific to client hostname or client network address
#   information.
#
#   - check_ccert_access type:table
#       Use the remote SMTP client  certificate fingerprint or  the public key fingerprint (Postfix
#       2.9 and later) as lookup  key for the specified access(5) database;  with Postfix 2.2, also
#       require that the remote  SMTP client certificate is  verified successfully. The fingerprint
#       digest algorithm is configurable via the smtpd_tls_fingerprint_digest parameter (hard-coded
#       as md5 prior to Postfix version 2.5). This feature is available with Postfix 2.2 and later.
#
#   - check_client_access type:table
#       Search the specified access database for the client hostname, parent domains, client IP ad-
#       dress, or networks obtained by stripping least significant octets. See the access(5) manual
#       page for details.
#
#   - check_client_a_access type:table
#       Search the specified  access(5) database for the IP addresses  for the client hostname, and
#       execute the corresponding action. Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.
#       Instead, use "DUNNO" in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists. This feature is a-
#       vailable in Postfix 3.0 and later.
#
#   - check_client_mx_access type:table
#       Search the specified  access(5) database for the MX hosts for the client hostname, and exe-
#       cute  the corresponding action.  Note: a result of "OK" is not  allowed for safety reasons.
#       Instead, use "DUNNO" in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists. This feature is a-
#       vailable in Postfix 2.7 and later.
#
#   - check_client_ns_access type:table
#       Search the specified  access(5) database for the DNS servers  for the client hostname,  and
#       execute the corresponding action. Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.
#       Instead, use "DUNNO" in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists. This feature is a-
#       vailable in Postfix 2.7 and later.
#
#   - check_reverse_client_hostname_access type:table
#       Search the specified access database for the unverified reverse client hostname, parent do-
#       mains,  client IP address,  or networks obtained by stripping least significant octets. See
#       the access(5) manual page for details. Note:a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety rea-
#       sons. Instead, use "DUNNO" in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists. This feature
#       is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.
#
#   - check_reverse_client_hostname_a_access type:table
#       Search the  specified access(5) database  for the IP addresses  for the unverified  reverse
#       client hostname, and execute the corresponding action. Note:a result of "OK" is not allowed
#       for safety reasons.  Instead, use DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists.
#       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.
#
#   - check_reverse_client_hostname_mx_access type:table
#       Search the specified access(5)  database for the MX hosts for the unverified reverse client
#       hostname, and execute the corresponding action.   Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for
#       safety reasons. Instead, use DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists. This
#       feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.
#
#   - check_reverse_client_hostname_ns_access type:table
#       Search the specified access(5) database for the DNS servers for the unverified reverse cli-
#       ent hostname,  and execute the corresponding action.  Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed
#       for safety reasons.  Instead, use DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from blacklists.
#       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.
#
#   - check_sasl_access type:table
#       Use the remote SMTP client SASL user name as lookup key for the specified access(5) db. The
#       The lookup key  has the form "username@domainname" when the smtpd_sasl_local_domain parame-
#       ter value is non-empty.  Unlike the check_client_access feature, check_sasl_access does not
#       perform matches of parent domains or IP subnet ranges.
#       This feature is available with Postfix version 2.11 and later.
#
#   - permit_inet_interfaces
#       Permit the request when the client IP address matches $inet_interfaces.
#
#   - permit_mynetworks
#       Permit the request when the client IP address matches any network or network address listed
#       in $mynetworks.
#
#   - permit_sasl_authenticated
#       Permit the request when the client is successfully authenticated via the RFC 4954 protocol.
#
#   - permit_tls_all_clientcerts
#       Permit the request when the remote SMTP client certificate is verified successfully.
#       This option must be used only if a special CA issues  the certificates  and only this CA is
#       listed as trusted CA.  Otherwise,  clients with a third-party certificate would also be al-
#       lowed to relay.  Specify "tls_append_default_CA = no" when the trusted CA is specified with
#       smtpd_tls_CAfile or smtpd_tls_CApath, to prevent Postfix from appending the system-supplied
#       default CAs. This feature is available with Postfix version 2.2.
#
#   - permit_tls_clientcerts
#       Permit the request when the remote SMTP client certificate fingerprint or public key finger
#       print (Postfix version 2.9 and later) is listed in  $relay_clientcerts. The fingerprint di-
#       gest algorithm is  configurable via the smtpd_tls_fingerprint_digest parameter  (hard-coded
#       as md5 prior to Postfix version 2.5). This feature is available with Postfix version 2.2.
#
#   - reject_rbl_client rbl_domain=d.d.d.d
#       Reject the  request  when the reversed  client network address is listed with  the A record
#       "d.d.d.d" under "rbl_domain" (Postfix 2.1 and later only).  Each "d" is a number, or a pat-
#       tern inside "[]" that contains one or more ";"-separated numbers or "number..number" ranges
#       (Postfix version 2.8 and later). If no "=d.d.d.d" is specified, reject the request when the
#       reversed client network address is listed with any A record under "rbl_domain".
#
#       The "maps_rbl_reject_code" parameter specifies the response code for rejected requests (de-
#       fault: 554),  the "default_rbl_reply" parameter specifies the default server reply, and the
#       "rbl_reply_maps"  parameter specifies  tables with server replies  indexed by "rbl_domain".
#       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
#
#   - permit_dnswl_client dnswl_domain=d.d.d.d
#       Accept  the  request when the reversed client  network  address is listed with the A record
#       "d.d.d.d" under  "dnswl_domain".  Each "d" is a number,  or a pattern inside "[]" that con-
#       tains one or more ";"-separated numbers or number..number ranges. If no "=d.d.d.d" is spec-
#       ified,  accept  the  request  when the reversed client network address is listed with any A
#       record under "dnswl_domain".  For safety, "permit_dnswl_client" is silently ignored when it
#       would override "reject_unauth_destination".  The result is "DEFER_IF_REJECT" when whitelist
#       lookup fails. This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.
#
#   - reject_rhsbl_client rbl_domain=d.d.d.d
#       Reject  the request  when the client hostname is  listed with the A record  "d.d.d.d" under
#       "rbl_domain" (Postfix 2.1 and later only).  Each "d" is a number,  or a pattern inside "[]"
#       that contains one or more ";"-separated numbers or "number..number" ranges (Postfix 2.8 and
#       later). If no "=d.d.d.d" is specified, reject the request when the client hostname is list-
#       ed with any A record under "rbl_domain".  See the "reject_rbl_client" description above for
#       additional RBL related configuration parameters.  This feature is available  in Postfix 2.0
#       and later;  with Postfix version 2.8 and later,  "reject_rhsbl_reverse_client" will usually
#       produce better results.
#
#   - permit_rhswl_client rhswl_domain=d.d.d.d
#       Accept  the request  when the client hostname  is listed with the  A record "d.d.d.d" under
#       "rhswl_domain".  Each "d" is a number,  or a pattern inside "[]" that contains  one or more
#       ";"-separated numbers or "number..number" ranges. If no "=d.d.d.d" is specified, accept the
#       request when the client hostname is listed with any A record under "rhswl_domain". 
#
#       Caution: client name whitelisting is fragile,  since the client name lookup can fail due to
#                temporary outages.  Client name whitelisting  should be used  only to reduce false
#                positives in e.g. DNS-based blocklists, and not for making access rule exceptions.
#
#       For safety,  "permit_rhswl_client" parameter  is silently  ignored  when it would  override
#       "reject_unauth_destination".   The result is "DEFER_IF_REJECT" when whitelist lookup fails.
#       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.
#
#   - reject_rhsbl_reverse_client rbl_domain=d.d.d.d
#       Reject the  request when the unverified reverse client hostname is listed with the A record
#       "d.d.d.d" under "rbl_domain".  Each "d" is a number, or a pattern inside "[]" that contains
#       one or more  ";"-separated numbers or "number..number" ranges.  If no "=d.d.d.d"  is speci-
#       fied,  reject the request when the unverified  reverse client hostname is listed with any A
#       record under "rbl_domain". See the "reject_rbl_client" description above for additional RBL
#       related configuration parameters. This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.
#
#   - reject_unknown_client_hostname (with Postfix < 2.3: reject_unknown_client)
#       Reject the request when
#         1) the client IP address->name mapping fails, or
#         2) the name->address mapping fails, or
#         3) the name->address mapping does not match the client IP address.
#       This is  a stronger restriction  than the "reject_unknown_reverse_client_hostname" feature,
#       which  triggers  only under condition 1) above.  The "unknown_client_reject_code" parameter
#       specifies  the response code for  rejected requests (default: 450). The reply is always 450
#       in case the address->name or name->address lookup failed due to a temporary problem.
#
#   - reject_unknown_reverse_client_hostname
#       Reject the request when the client IP address has no address->name mapping.This is a weaker
#       restriction than the "reject_unknown_client_hostname" feature, which requires not only that
#       the address->name and  name->address mappings exist,  but also that the two mappings repro-
#       duce the client IP address.
#
#       The unknown_client_reject_code  parameter specifies the response code for rejected requests
#       (default: 450).  The reply is always "450" in case the address->name lookup failed due to a
#       temporary problem. This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.
#
#   In addition,  you can use any of the following generic restrictions. These restrictions are ap-
#   plicable in any SMTP command context.
#
#   - check_policy_service servername
#       Query the specified policy server. See the "SMTPD_POLICY_README" document for details. This
#       feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
#
#   - defer
#       Defer the request. The client is told to try again later. This restriction is useful at the
#       end of a restriction list,  to make the default policy explicit. The "defer_code" parameter
#       specifies the SMTP server reply code (default: 450).
#
#   - defer_if_permit
#       Defer the request  if some later restriction would result in an explicit or implicit PERMIT
#       action.  This is useful when a blacklisting feature fails due to a temporary problem.  This
#       feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.
#
#   - defer_if_reject
#       Defer the request if some later restriction would result in a REJECT action. This is useful
#       when a whitelisting feature fails due to a temporary problem.  This feature is available in
#       Postfix version 2.1 and later.
#
#   - permit
#       Permit the request.  This restriction is useful  at the end of a restriction list,  to make
#       the default policy explicit.
#
#   - reject_multi_recipient_bounce
#       Reject the request when the envelope sender is the null address, and the message has multi-
#       ple  envelope  recipients.  This usage has rare but legitimate applications:  under certain
#       conditions,  multi-recipient mail that was posted with the DSN option "NOTIFY=NEVER" may be
#       forwarded with the null sender address.
#
#       Note: this restriction can only  work reliably  when used in  "smtpd_data_restrictions"  or
#             "smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions", because the total number of recipients is not known
#             at an earlier stage of the SMTP conversation.  Use at the RCPT stage will only reject
#             the second etc. recipient. 
#
#       The "multi_recipient_bounce_reject_code" parameter specifies the response code for rejected
#       requests (default: 550). This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
#
#   - reject_plaintext_session
#       Reject  the request  when the connection is not  encrypted.  This restriction should not be
#       used  before the client has had a chance to negotiate  encryption with the AUTH or STARTTLS
#       commands.
#
#       The plaintext_reject_code specifies the response code for rejected requests (default: 450).
#       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.
#
#   - reject_unauth_pipelining
#       Reject the request when the client sends SMTP commands ahead of time where it is not allow-
#       ed, or when the client sends SMTP commands ahead of time without knowing that Postfix actu-
#       ally  supports ESMTP command pipelining.  This stops mail from  bulk mail software that im-
#       properly uses ESMTP command pipelining in order to speed up deliveries. 
#
#       With Postfix version 2.6 and later, the SMTP server sets a per-session flag whenever it de-
#       tects illegal pipelining, including pipelined HELO or EHLO commands.
#       The reject_unauth_pipelining feature simply tests  whether the flag was set at any point in
#       time during the session. With older Postfix versions, "reject_unauth_pipelining" checks the
#       current status of the input read queue,  and its usage is not recommended in contexts other
#       than "smtpd_data_restrictions".
#
#   - reject
#       Reject the request.  This restriction is useful  at the end of  a restriction list, to make
#       the default policy explicit. The reject_code configuration parameter specifies the response
#       code for rejected requests (default: 554).
#
#   - sleep seconds
#       Pause for the specified number of seconds and proceed with the next restriction in the list
#       if any. This may stop zombie mail when used as:
#           /etc/postfix/main.cf:
#               smtpd_client_restrictions = sleep 1, reject_unauth_pipelining
#               smtpd_delay_reject = no
#
#   - warn_if_reject
#       A safety net for testing. When "warn_if_reject" is placed before a reject-type restriction,
#       access table query, or check_policy_service query, this logs a "reject_warning" message in-
#       stead of rejecting  a request (when a reject-type restriction  fails due to a temporary er-
#       ror, this logs a "reject_warning"  message for any implicit  "defer_if_permit" actions that
#       would normally prevent mail from being accepted by some later access restriction). 
#       This feature has no effect on defer_if_reject restrictions.
#
#   Other restrictions that are valid in this context:
#     - SMTP command specific restrictions  that are described under the "smtpd_helo_restrictions",
#       "smtpd_sender_restrictions" or "smtpd_recipient_restrictions" parameters. When helo, sender
#       or recipient restrictions are listed under smtpd_client_restrictions, they have effect only
#       with "smtpd_delay_reject = yes",  so that "$smtpd_client_restrictions"  is evaluated at the
#       time of the RCPT TO command.
