# SigningTable (dataset)
#   Defines a table used to select one or more signatures to apply to a message based on the ad-
#   dress found in the From: header field.
#
#   Keys in this table vary depending on the type of table used; values in this data set should in-
#   clude one field that contains a name found in the KeyTable that identifies which key should be
#   used in generating the signature, and an optional second field naming the signer of the message
#   that will be included in the "i=" tag in the generated signature.
#
#   Note that the "i=" value will not be included in the signature if it conflicts with the signing
#   domain (the "d=" value).

#   If the first field contains only a "%" character, it will be replaced by the domain found in
#   the From: header  field. Similarly, within the optional second field, any "%" character will be
#   replaced by the domain found in the From: header field.

#   If this table specifies a regular expression file ("refile"), then the keys are wildcard pat-
#   terns that are matched against the address found in the From: header field. Entries are checked
#   in the order in which they appear in the file.

#   For all other database types, the full "user@host" is checked first, then simply host, then
#   user@.domain (with all superdomains checked in sequence, so "foo.example.com" would first check
#   "user@foo.example.com", then "user@.example.com", then "user@.com"), then .domain, then user@*,
#   and finally *.

#   In any case, only the first match is applied, unless "MultipleSignatures" is enabled in which
#   case all matches are applied.
